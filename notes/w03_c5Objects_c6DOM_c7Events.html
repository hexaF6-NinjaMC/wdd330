            <h2>The Notes:</h2>
<p>Objects:</p><p>Object literals</p><p>An object literal is an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces {}. They allow objects to be created quickly without need for defining a class.</p><p>Adding properties to objects</p><p>ES6 has added way to compute properties, such as</p><p>	const hulk = { name: {Hulk}, [{catch} + {Phrase}]: {Hulk Smash!} };</p><p>This is the same as the <em>hulk</em> object having the following properties:</p><p>	{ name: {Hulk}, catchphrase: {Hulk Smash!} }</p><p>Values of properties can also be JavaScript expressions, like</p><p>	const bewitched = true;</p><p>	const captainBritain = { name: {Captain Britain}, hero: bewitched ? false : true };</p><p>This makes the value of the <em>hero</em> property dependent upon the Boolean value of <em>bewitched</em>.</p><p>Symbol data-type objects can also be used as a computed property key.</p><p>Accessing properties are done by square brackets [].</p><p>	variable[property];</p><p>	&gt;&gt; propertyValue</p><p>Object methods</p><p>Calling methods of objects is done the same as functions, using parentheses ().</p><p>superman.fly();</p><p> &gt;&gt;<em>Up, up, and away!</em></p><p>Checking if they exist is done by using the <em>in</em> operator:</p><p>{city} in superman;</p><p> false</p><p>You can also use <em>hasOwnProperty</em>() to check if the object has its own, rather than if it inherited it. This will <strong>only</strong> return any properties that belong to that particular object, whereas <em>in</em> or {!== undefined} will return <em>true</em>, even if the property has been inherited from another object.</p><p>You can find all properties of an object using <em>for-in</em> loops. For example;</p><p><em>for(const </em>key <em>in </em>superman) {</p><p>&amp;nbsp;console.log(key + {: } + superman[key]);</p><p>}</p><p>returns all the property names (keys) and their values to the console window.</p><p>Objects are <strong>NEVER</strong> like an ordered list like an array, set, or map, so do not rely on them as such, with properties in a certain order!</p><p>JSON</p><p>JSON - <strong>FUNCTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED VALUES</strong></p><p>Use <em>stringify</em>() to format JavaScript Objects to a String object of JSON data. Methods defined within the object are ignored by the <em>stringify</em>() method.</p><p>Math object</p><p>Date object</p><p><strong>Use getFullYear(), not getYear().</strong></p><p>RegExp object</p><p>RegExp, or Regular Expression, is a pattern to search string for matches to the pattern (common to use in find and replace).</p><p>Using carots ^ negates the expression sequence, like</p><p><strong><em>/[^A-Z]/</em></strong></p><p>represents anything <em>not</em> a capital letter.</p>
