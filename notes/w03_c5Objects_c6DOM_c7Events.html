Objects

Object literals

An object literal is an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces {}. They allow objects to be created quickly without need for defining a class.

Adding properties to objects

ES6 has added way to compute properties, such as

	const hulk = { name: ‘Hulk’, [‘catch’ + ‘Phrase’]: ‘Hulk Smash!’ };

This is the same as the hulk object having the following properties:

	{ name: ‘Hulk’, catchphrase: ‘Hulk Smash!’ }

Values of properties can also be JavaScript expressions, like

	const bewitched = true;

	const captainBritain = { name: ‘Captain Britain’, hero: bewitched ? false : true };

This makes the value of the hero property dependent upon the Boolean value of bewitched.

Symbol data-type objects can also be used as a computed property key.



Accessing properties are done by square brackets [].

	variable[property];

	>> propertyValue

Object methods

Calling methods of objects is done the same as functions, using parentheses ().

superman.fly();

	>> ‘Up, up, and away!’

Checking if they exist is done by using the in operator:

	‘city’ in superman;

	>> false		

You can also use hasOwnProperty() to check if the object has its own, rather than if it inherited it. This will only return any properties that belong to that particular object, whereas in or “!== undefined” will return true, even if the property has been inherited from another object.

You can find all properties of an object using for-in loops. For example;

	for(const key in superman) {

		console.log(key + “: ” + superman[key]);

	}

returns all the property names (keys) and their values to the console window.

Objects are NEVER like an ordered list like an array, set, or map, so do not rely on them as such, with properties in a certain order!

JSON

JSON – FUNCTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED VALUES

Use stringify() to format JavaScript Objects to a String object of JSON data. Methods defined within the object are ignored by the stringify() method.

Math object

Date object

Use getFullYear(), not getYear().

RegExp object

RegExp, or Regular Expression, is a pattern to search string for matches to the pattern (common to use in “find and replace”).

Using carots ^ negates the expression sequence, like

	/[^A-Z]/

represents anything not a capital letter.
