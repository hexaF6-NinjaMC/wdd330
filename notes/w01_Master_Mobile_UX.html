            <h2>The Notes:</h2>
<p>Design for least powerful, smallest device first = greater and firstly focus on content + core functionality = simple beautiful apps</p><p>paradigm shift:</p><p>decline of PC sales post-2011, mobile and tabular devices essentially introduced 2007, sales skyrocket 2011 and jump MUCH more.</p><p>PCs are generally replaced 4-5 years, whereas mobile devices after about 2 years.</p><p>Mobile traffic up 18.6% over 2-13</p><p>-December 2013: about 40%</p><p>-December 2014: more than 50% (about 55-60%)</p><p>responsive retrofitting:</p><p>-Pros: Cheaper, faster than ground-up re-writes; Can suit your desktop-designed sites to a better mobile experience.</p><p>-Cons: Doesn't address screen &quot;real estate&quot; issues; Doesn't address touch interaction issues.</p><p>Mobile-first Design:</p><p>-Pros: Provides the best experience across many devices; Addresses constraints of mobile size/bandwidth; Future friendly and ready for growth.</p><p>-Cons: Time-consuming and costly for a full rebuild, especially for larger websites and companies.</p><p>REMEMBER:</p><p>Desktop computer sales have been declining since 2011.</p><p>You don't see people with their heads in laptops.</p><p>Start small, scale up. (Mobile first!)</p><p>Mobile is NOT A FAD!</p><p>Steve Jobs: &quot;It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them.&quot;</p><p>1. Be there.</p><p>2. Be Useful.</p><p>-Only 9% of users will stay if it doesn't satisfy their needs.</p><p>3. Be Quick.</p><p>75% of people rely on thumbs, 49% rely on one-handed grip.</p><p>Google: .5 second delay = 20% drop in traffic.</p><p>Bing: 2 second delay = 4% drop in revenue.</p><p>AOL.: Fastest 10% of users stay 50% longer.</p><p>Reduce image use throughout sites/apps.</p><p>SVG/Web fonts are lower bandwidth.</p><p>Optimize and minify CSS and JS files.</p><p>GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data.</p><p>Mobile primary controls placed in the most reachable places = best practice.</p><p>&quot;Hamburger&quot; icon is NOT the best way to show &quot;menu&quot;: &quot;menu&quot; with border without Hamburger achieved 20%+ clicks, while with the icon to &quot;rewire&quot; users' brains achieved ~6%. Just &quot;menu&quot; as a word without borders DROPPED more than 20% clicks! AVOID THIS!</p><p>FORMS:</p><p>USE FLOAT LABELS!</p><p>If need contact by phone, use radio to display phone input field; email, email field.</p><p>Possibly use progress bar?</p><p>Enable auto-complete/auto-fill.</p><p>Use single-line input field that auto-progresses through input fields to obtain credit card information.</p><p>Provide the right keyboard for the text field, i.e., keypad for phone numbers.</p><p>use anchor tags to call from mobile devices, like &lt;a href=&quot;tel:14035551234&quot;&gt;405-555-1234&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>Mobile Advertising:</p><p>Make ad smaller, and increase size as necessary.</p><p>Make use of video ads! These are the next best thing to date!</p><p>Use dynamic windows to showcase ads?</p><p>Question: how effective is this compared to video ads, and which network favors video ads? Which one is better for 3G networks?</p><p>REMEMBER: Content first, ads later, un-obtrusively.</p>
