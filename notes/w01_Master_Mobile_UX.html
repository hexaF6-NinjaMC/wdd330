design for least powerful, smallest device first = greater and firstly focus on content + core functionality = simple beautiful apps



paradigm shift:

decline of PC sales post-2011, mobile and tabular devices essentially introduced 2007, sales skyrocket 2011 and jump MUCH more.



PCs are generally replaced 4-5 years, whereas mobile devices after about 2 years.



Mobile traffic up 18.6% over 2-13

-December 2013: about 40%

-December 2014: more than 50% (about 55-60%)



responsive retrofitting:

-Pros: Cheaper, faster than ground-up re-writes; Can suit your desktop-designed sites to a better mobile experience.

-Cons: Doesn't address screen "real estate" issues; Doesn't address touch interaction issues.



Mobile-first Design:

-Pros: Provides the best experience across many devices; Addresses constraints of mobile size/bandwidth; Future friendly and ready for growth.

-Cons: Time-consuming and costly for a full rebuild, especially for larger websites and companies.



REMEMBER:

Desktop computer sales have been declining since 2011.

You don't see people with their heads in laptops.

Start small, scale up. (Mobile first!)

Mobile is NOT A FAD!



Steve Jobs: "It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them."



1. Be there.

2. Be Useful.

-Only 9% of users will stay if it doesn't satisfy their needs.

3. Be Quick.



75% of people rely on thumbs, 49% rely on one-handed grip.



Google: .5 second delay = 20% drop in traffic.

Bing: 2 second delay = 4% drop in revenue.

AOL.: Fastest 10% of users stay 50% longer.



Reduce image use throughout sites/apps.

SVG/Web fonts are lower bandwidth.

Optimize and minify CSS and JS files.

GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data.



Mobile primary controls placed in the most reachable places = best practice.

"hamburger" icon is NOT the best way to show "menu": "menu" with border without Hamburger achieved 20%+ clicks, while with the icon to "rewire" users' brains achieved ~6%. Just "menu" as a word without borders DROPPED more than 20% clicks! AVOID THIS!



FORMS:

USE FLOAT LABELS!

If need contact by phone, use radio to display phone input field; email, email field.

Possibly use progress bar?

Enable auto-complete/auto-fill.

Use single-line input field that auto-progresses through input fields to obtain credit card information.



provide the right keyboard for the text field, i.e., keypad for phone numbers.



use anchor tags to call from m mobile devices, like

<a href="tel:14035551234">405-555-1234</a>



Mobile Advertising:

Make ad smaller, and increase size as necessary.

Make use of video ads! These are the next best thing to date!



Use dynamic windows to showcase ads?

Question: how effective is this compared to video ads, and which network favors video ads? Which one is better for 3G networks?



REMEMBER:

Content first, ads later, un-obtrusively.
