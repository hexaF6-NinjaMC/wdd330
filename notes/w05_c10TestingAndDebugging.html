            <h2>The Notes:</h2>
<p>Exceptions raise stack traces, while warnings generally do not.</p><p>It is most effective to make your JS code run with a warning bell than to keep running silently, passing by errors after. Keep the user experience at best quality, but do not let errors pile on in the background.</p><p>Strict mode is done using {use strict;, in quotes} at the beginning of your portion of code to be run. It is considered best practice to use it inside of a self-invoking function, like so:</p><p><em>(function() {</em></p><p><em>use strict;</em></p><p><em>// All your code would go inside this function.</em></p><p><em>}());</em></p><p>If you are using external code, there is no guarantee it was coded in strict mode. This will ensure your code is in strict mode, unaffecting the other portions.</p><p>Modules (introduced in ES6) are in strict mode by default, so it is unnecessary to use the strict mode declaration string.</p><p>Linting tools - look into these:</p><p>-JS Lint</p><p>-JS Hint</p><p>-ES Lint</p><p>These test the quality of your JS code, and can be very <em>unforgiving</em>. They can impart some opinionated practices, like the ++ and -- increment/decrement operators. They can also enforce a set styling guide, which is beneficial for team projects, ensuring everyone uses the same styling conventions.</p>
